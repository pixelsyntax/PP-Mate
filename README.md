Ludum Dare 39 entry, made in 48 hours

Took some advice and tried to create the whole game in a single file to avoid 'wasting time on organisation and OOP' but it didn't work out very well. Towards the end I was adding new classes in new files because I was completely lost in my Game.hx. I think single file / single class probably takes significantly more discipline to keep organised than the alternatives, but it was a good opportunity to experiment. 

Builds with openfl 5.1.5 and lime 5.2.1
